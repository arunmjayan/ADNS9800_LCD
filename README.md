ADNS9800_LCD
============

Arduino Uno with ADNS-9800 and OSEPP LCD

The project combines ADNS-9800 Optical sensor by John Kicklighter with OSEPP 16Ã—2 LCD Display & Keypad Shield on an Arduino Uno. The code is modified from original to include Motion Burst and distance measurement. C++ namespace and 2 classes are introduced to better organize the code.
